# Test: 1_cicd/dist/ + .github/workflows/ are in sync with the
# corresponding src/cicd/ + src/scripts/ + src/test/.
#
# Why: today (2026-04-27) saw multiple agents push src changes without
# running 9_others/build.sh deploy. Result: .github/workflows/ on
# origin diverged from src/cicd/ by 2+ commits, and ship runs failed at
# the matrix-detect step (cloud-data-gha-config.json missing because
# the regen pre-step lived in src but never got deployed).
#
# Fix: this lint runs `9_others/build.sh build` then checks that
# dist/ + .github/workflows/ match what the engine emits. Any drift
# fails the lint with a clear message pointing at the build step.

# ── The compile-only verb must be non-destructive and mode-faithful ────
#
# Both checks above invoke `build.sh` with no verb — the full ship pipeline —
# and compare with `diff -rq`, which does not look at permissions. Between them
# they were blind to #399 in both of its halves:
#
#   · `build.sh build` purged 0_apps/dist and 0_git/dist but had no step that
#     re-emits the dotfiles tree or dist/LICENSE, so the compile-only verb
#     DELETED 15 committed artifacts. `ship` put them straight back, so this
#     lint never saw a thing.
#   · The exec bit arrived from a `chmod +x` in the DEPLOY phase, which reached
#     into dist through the .github/workflows/scripts symlink. `build` alone
#     therefore left 34 scripts at 644 — and a mode diff is exactly what
#     `diff -rq` does not report.
#
# git is the right oracle: it tracks content AND the exec bit, and "clean status
# after a rebuild" is precisely the contract dist/ has to meet. Checking the
# cheap verb also matters on its own — `build` is what an agent reaches for when
# it does not want to touch install paths, and it must be safe to run.
