# A Ship run that detected services to ship and then did not ship them must be RED.
#
# 2026-09-09, run 34334421319: detect logged "detect: a_solutions
# af913083..902bbba9" and "VMs: 1 - oci-apps", Build -> oci-apps pushed the
# my-ai_claude-api image successfully, and Deploy -> oci-apps then ran ZERO
# steps. It was evicted from the fleet-wide ship-wg-runner concurrency group
# (GitHub keeps exactly one pending entry per group, so the next
# containers-push displaces the one waiting) while a wedged cgc-db run held
# the slot. The run ended "cancelled": grey in the UI, no notification,
# indistinguishable from a human pressing cancel. The commit sat in git, the
# image sat in GHCR, and oci-apps kept serving three-hour-old code behind a
# Ship page that looked idle.
#
# The gate turns that silence into a failure. `always()` is load-bearing: a job
# cancelled by concurrency does not cancel the run, which is the only reason a
# downstream job can observe the eviction at all.

#
# That is not hypothetical. This test was written 2026-09-09 against a gate that
# read three variables. #401's rewrite (c942be58f) added DETECT_RESULT, VERDICT
# and HAS_VMS, this test kept exporting the original three, and all five
# behavioural cases silently stopped testing the gate — they were asserting the
# exit code of an unbound-variable crash. Phase 55 caught it the first time it
# ever ran to completion (run 35169520755).
#
# So assert the agreement rather than assume it: every env key the step declares
# must be one this test knows how to supply. When someone extends the gate
# again, this fails FIRST, by name, instead of poisoning everything below it.
