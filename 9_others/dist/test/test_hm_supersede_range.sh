# test_hm_supersede_range.sh — a newer "Ship → home-manager" run may supersede
# (cancel) an older QUEUED one only because its gate covers every change since
# the last run that covered the fleet.
#
# Incident 2026-10-14: 13 home-manager runs queued in ship-wg-runner (FIFO,
# workflow level) ahead of the Matomo/Dagu/wireguard/Caddy deploys. The newest
# queued run's own commit (a gen-configs refresh) touched nothing any VM's
# build reads, so under the HEAD^..HEAD gate it would have deployed NOTHING —
# "keep only the newest" would have dropped the older runs' deliveries.
#
# Under test:
#   1. cloud-ship-hm-supersede-range.sh `base`: which older run covered the
#      fleet (in flight or success; never cancelled/failed/skipped/dispatch).
#   2. `paths`: base..HEAD, every non-b_infra path, b_infra paths ONLY from
#      [deploy-fleet] commits (#414 consent is per commit), exit 3 when unknown.
#   3. End-to-end with the real path-relevance helper on a fixture repo: the
#      incident shape deploys with the range, skips without it.
#   4. Workflow wiring (source AND generated .github copy) + generated copies
#      equal source + banner.
#   5. Mutation: a base filter that counts cancelled runs as covering, or that
#      lets b_infra through without the marker, is caught.
