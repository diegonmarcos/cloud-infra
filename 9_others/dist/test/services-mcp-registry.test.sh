# Runs the cloud-services-mcp registry self-checks (#377, #378).
#
# The registry module physically lives in the PRE-RENAME tree
# (a_solutions/infra-api_c3-services-api/src/code/registry/) and is symlinked
# into infra-api_cloud-services-mcp. Two defects of the same shape have already
# shipped from that arrangement, and both were silent:
#
#   #371  Both loaders restated the peer map filename as the literal
#         "build-c3-services-api.json". The container was renamed, the literal
#         stopped matching, the registry loaded ZERO services, getBaseUrl()
#         returned null for every one of them, and every tool quietly fell back
#         to a hardcoded address. infra.matomo.* dialled 10.0.0.4 for weeks
#         while the declaration said 10.0.0.6. Nothing raised.
#
#   #378  The name is derived from build.json now, but the dev-tree fallback
#         derived it by walking up from the MODULE'S OWN location. Node
#         resolves symlinks, so that always landed back in the pre-rename tree
#         and re-derived the OLD name — silently, for every container that
#         borrows the module.
#
# Both self-checks print one line per assertion and a final count. This wrapper
# asserts the count actually appeared: a runner that dies on module resolution
# exits non-zero having printed nothing that looks like a failed assertion, and
# an earlier report on this very work was called green on exactly that basis.
#
# A missing self-check is a FAILURE, never a skip. That is the whole subject of
# #368 and there is no third outcome here.

# from the fix — a green ship run deploying a defect that was already declared

# ── The peer-map symlinks are dependency edges, not broken links ────────
#
# a_solutions/*/src/build-*.json are relative symlinks to
# 1_cloud-configs/dist/build-*.json. There are 671 of them and ALL of them
# dangle in a standalone cloud-u-containers checkout, because the path resolves
# only when the repo sits at a_solutions/ inside cloud-infra — which is exactly
# how CI checks it out and how .gitmodules (lines 33-43) says the split was
# designed.
#
# That dangle looks like a bug and repointing it would be a real one. ship.yml
# reverse-walks these links with `readlink -f` to map a regenerated dist file
# back to the services that consume it; a link that no longer resolves to
# 1_cloud-configs/dist stops being found, and its service silently stops being
# rebuilt when its own peer map changes. A no-ship that reports success is the
# #371 failure mode, and it would have been introduced by "fixing" the link.
#
# So the assertion is that the convention HOLDS, not that the link resolves here.
# Content is never read through this path: the loaders probe /app first and
# peer-map.ts derives its development candidate from the container ROOT, one
# level above src/. Nothing dereferences src/build-*.json for content, which is
# why #378's fallback is unaffected by any of this and stays exercisable.
