# Guards seed_from_config.sh against the defect it was named for (#387).
#
# The script is called seed_from_config.sh and it did read the topology
# declaration — for VM identity, service lists and hosted_on edges. But the
# WireGuard addresses, arch, CPU and RAM were restated inside it as literals
# under the comment "hardcoded from cloud architecture", and they drifted:
#
#   - oci-A1-f_1 (10.0.0.2) and oci-A1-p_0 (10.0.0.7) stayed in the table after
#     both VMs were decommissioned. Neither is a typo; their declarations are
#     archived under b_infra/z_archive/vm_oci-A1-f_1/ and vm_oci-A1-p_0/. The
#     declared mesh is four VMs.
#   - the generator built the WireGuard mesh from those keys, so it emitted 15
#     connected_to edges where the declaration supports 6, and 9 of the 15
#     RELATEd to vm: nodes it had never CREATEd. A dangling edge in a knowledge
#     graph does not raise; it answers questions wrongly.
#   - it also recorded oci-A1-f_0 as 3 CPU / 16 GB against a declared 4 / 24.
#
# Correcting the literals would have left the next decommission free to do this
# again, so the tables are derived now. These assertions are what stops them
# coming back, and they are behavioural: a grep alone would not have caught the
# dangling edges, which were the actual damage.
#
# A missing script or declaration is a FAILURE, never a skip (#368).
