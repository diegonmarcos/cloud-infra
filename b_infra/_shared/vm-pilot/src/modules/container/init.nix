  # ── Boot autostart gate — data-driven, never hand-flipped ────────────
  # Docker is disabled from systemd auto-start and every compose service is
  # generated with restart:"no" (a_solutions/_shared/docker.nix), on the stated
  # premise that container-init owns the lifecycle. But container-init was
  # script-only, so in practice NOTHING owned it: a reboot left the VM with
  # zero containers until a human ran the script or CI happened to re-ship.
  # oci-apps rebooted 2026-08-30 22:11 and vaultwarden stayed down 4 days.
  #
  # The original "no boot unit" call was about boot OOM on the 1GB E2 Micros,
  # which is a real constraint — cmd_boot pulls images and starts services
  # sequentially, and three of the four VMs have 1GB of RAM. So gate on the
  # declared spec rather than blanket-enabling: >=2GB gets the boot unit,
  # micros keep the manual-start behaviour they were tuned for. Today that is
  # oci-apps (24GB) only; a resized VM picks it up from cloud-data with no
  # edit here.
  # isInt guard: ram_gb is null for VMs cloud-data has not fully described
  # (vast-ollama today), and `null >= 2` is an eval ERROR, not false — which
  # would fail the whole home-manager generation for that VM rather than just
  # this option. Unknown size ⇒ 0 ⇒ manual start, the conservative branch.
