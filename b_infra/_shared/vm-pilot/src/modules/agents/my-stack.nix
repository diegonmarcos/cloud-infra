# vm-pilot as the HUB for the two products that used to live inside it.
#
# WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
# vm-pilot implemented "a web server and a watchdog" itself: busybox httpd on
# 7680 serving symlinked directories, and a data-publisher timer writing
# containers.json every five minutes. Both jobs now belong to products of their
# own in cloud-u-linux — my-webserver and my-watchdog — for the same reason the
# sampler left my-konsole: the coupling was never more than a file path, and
# owning a second implementation of somebody else's job is how the two drift.
#
# So this module deploys them and gets out of the way. vm-pilot keeps what is
# genuinely its own — the protection layers, the alerting, the identity and
# rescue paths — and stops carrying a metrics stack alongside them.
#
# WHAT THIS GIVES THE FLEET
#   * my-watchdog samples this machine every 2s and publishes one snapshot,
#     the same shape the desktop publishes, so the hub's panel describes a VM
#     exactly as it describes the laptop.
#   * my-webserver answers /__api__/watchdog with that file, so the hub reads
#     it over HTTP instead of opening an ssh session and running a collector
#     script on the far end — which is both slower and a portability problem
#     on every box with BusyBox df or mawk.
#
# NO BUILDING HERE. Both are fetched as prebuilt binaries, statically linked
# against musl so one artifact per architecture runs on the Ubuntu, Fedora and
# NixOS boxes alike. Compiling Rust on these VMs is what no-build-guard.nix
# exists to prevent.
