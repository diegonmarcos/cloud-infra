# Drives load-shedder-arm-check.sh against a scripted `systemctl` and `pgrep`.
#
# WHY: on 2026-10-01 oci-analytics wrote /run/load-shedder.deploy-failed while
# load-shedder.service was active — a `timeout 10 systemctl is-active` killed
# by load was read as "inactive". Both directions are pinned here:
#   slow-but-active must ARM, and a really inactive/failed unit must NOT.
#
# Each scenario lists one systemctl answer per `show` call: a state word, or
# SLOW (the stub sleeps past the timeout, so `timeout` kills it).
# Run:  sh test-load-shedder-arm-check.sh
