# Test #393: the disk-watchdog's docker prunes must be SCOPED, so that automatic
# disk pressure can never delete a declared container, a tagged fleet image, or
# any volume.
#
# WHY this test exists
# ────────────────────
# infra/prune-maintenance.nix carries the scoped filter and the comment explaining
# it. watchdog.nix — its sibling, running every 5 minutes as root — never received
# it. On 2026-09-16 that gap deleted matomo off oci-apps: healthy at
# 2026-09-15T22:39:58Z, then `container prune` took the container at 05:24:46 and
# the CRIT branch untagged matomo-binaries:latest and matomo-configs:latest at
# 06:30:21. It freed 22.44MB against a ~19GB shortfall.
#
# protection/guardrails.nix already BLOCKS these operations — but only as a PATH
# wrapper in ~/.local/bin, which a root systemd unit never traverses. So the ban
# has to be asserted against this source file directly. That is this test.
#
# Run:  sh test-watchdog-scoped-prune.sh
