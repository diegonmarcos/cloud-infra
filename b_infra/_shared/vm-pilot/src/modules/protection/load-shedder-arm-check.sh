# load-shedder-arm-check.sh — did load-shedder.service actually arm?
#
# Run by load-shedder.nix's activation (as root) right after the no-block
# restart. Exit 0 = armed, 1 = NOT armed (the caller writes
# /run/load-shedder.deploy-failed and pages).
#
# WHY a script of its own: on 2026-10-01 oci-analytics (1 CPU, 954M) logged
# "FAILED TO ARM" and wrote the failure marker while the unit was active. The
# old check was `timeout 10 systemctl is-active` twice: under load systemctl
# took longer than 10s to answer, `timeout` killed it, and a killed query was
# read as "inactive". A query that did not answer is UNKNOWN, not inactive.
#
# Verdict rules (a real failure is never masked):
#   active                       → armed
#   activating / reloading       → still coming up, ask again
#   no answer within TIMEOUT     → unknown, ask again (box is slow, not broken)
#   inactive / failed / other    → restart once, ask again; if that is still
#                                  the answer at the end → NOT armed
#   never a single answer across all ATTEMPTS → fall back to the process
#     itself: the shedder loop running IS the protection. No process → NOT armed.
#
# Usage: load-shedder-arm-check.sh ATTEMPTS TIMEOUT_SECS PAUSE_SECS
# Worst-case wall time ≈ ATTEMPTS × (TIMEOUT + PAUSE); activation must never block.
