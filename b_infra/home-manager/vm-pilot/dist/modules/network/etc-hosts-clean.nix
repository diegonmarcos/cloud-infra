#
# Asserts /etc/hosts contains NO loopback/internal hijacks for canonical service
# domains. Caddy on gcp-proxy is THE sole route owner — every hostname resolution
# from any VM must go through real DNS → Caddy → backend.
#
# Past hand-edits added entries like `127.0.0.1 mail.diegonmarcos.com` to oci-mail's
# /etc/hosts to "force local delivery" or shortcut Maddy hairpins. Those bypass
# Caddy and create silent inconsistencies (e.g. cypht trying mail.diegonmarcos.com
# for JMAP gets local Maddy with no JMAP listener — Fire Rule #1 violation).
#
# This module runs on every HM activation and idempotently strips any line in
# /etc/hosts that maps a "*.diegonmarcos.com" hostname (other than what /etc/hosts
# legitimately needs — localhost, the VM's own hostname). Real DNS resolution
# applies to everything else.
#
# Source-of-truth contract: routes are owned by Caddy (build-caddy.json derived
# from each service's build.json#proxy.primary). /etc/hosts has no business
# overriding those.
