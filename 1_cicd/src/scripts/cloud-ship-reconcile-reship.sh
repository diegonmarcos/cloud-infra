# The half of #354 that was missing. The deploy gate in ship.yml already
# DETECTS an evicted deploy and fails loudly; what never existed is anything
# that puts the lost deploy back on the queue. cloud-ship-reconcile.sh finds
# the services the fleet is behind on; this decides which of them to actually
# dispatch, and refuses to dispatch more than the WG runner can absorb.
#
# Kept separate from the reconcile itself for one reason: the reconcile is
# read-only and must stay that way, so that running it to ask a question can
# never move the fleet. This script is the only place that decides to act.
#
#   stdin  : cloud-ship-reconcile.sh findings — <vm> <dir> <class> <detail>
#   stdout : comma-separated service dirs for ship.yml's `services` input,
#            empty when there is nothing to do
#   stderr : what was selected, what was held back, and why
#   exit 0 : always. "nothing to re-ship" is a normal outcome, not a failure;
#            the reconcile itself already exited non-zero to report the drift.
#
# Bounds come from 9_others/ship-reconcile.json — see that file for why each
# one exists. Nothing about which classes are safe or how many services fit in
# one lock hold is encoded here.
