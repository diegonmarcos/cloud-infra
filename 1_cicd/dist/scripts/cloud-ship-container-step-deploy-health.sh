# Step: Post-deploy health check — waits for all containers to be healthy
# Sourced by cloud-ship-container-engine.sh

# Assert every PUBLISHED port actually accepts a connection on the host.
#
# Container health is not service health: on 2026-08-29 a stalwart deploy
# recreated stalwart_default, the container moved to a new bridge IP, and
# docker left 10 DNAT rules pointing at the OLD address on a bridge that no
# longer existed. Zero rules pointed at the live container. Every published
# port — JMAP, IMAP, SMTP, ManageSieve — refused connections while the
# container reported `healthy`, because its healthcheck curls 127.0.0.1 from
# *inside* the netns and never crosses the NAT that was broken. The deploy
# went green and the mail server was dark.
#
# ponytail: a TCP connect, not a protocol probe. Anything deeper needs
# per-service knowledge the engine does not have, and a refused connect is
# the failure mode NAT breakage actually produces.
# Re-point published-port DNAT at the containers' current addresses, by piping
# cloud-ship-container-sync-dnat.sh to the host. See that script for why.
# Non-fatal: it is a repair, and _assert_published_ports is the actual verdict.

# ── #560: a container in `created` is DEAD, not stale ─────────────────
# An evicted deploy left my-ai-api in state `created`: never started, no logs,
# ExitCode 0. `docker ps -a` listed it, its image digest matched the registry,
# and both telegram bots were down behind a deploy that looked fine. Every
# cheap probe read healthy because none of them asked the one question that
# matters: did this container ever START? `docker compose ps` (no -a) does not
# even list a created container, so the wait loop below never saw it.
#
# The declared list comes from build.json's containers{}, not from whatever
# compose happens to list — a container compose never started is exactly the
# one a compose listing can omit.
#
# Pure, so the tester can drive it without a VM:
#   $1     declared container names (whitespace separated)
#   $2     declared one-shot names (containers{}.<k>.one_shot == true)
#   stdin  "<name>|<State.Status>|<State.ExitCode>" per line, as docker inspect prints
#   stdout "DEAD <name> <why>" / "MISSING <name>" per finding
#   rc     1 iff any declared container is DEAD
# Live = running, or restarting (step_health's crash-loop check owns that one,
# with logs). exited is live ONLY for a declared one-shot that exited 0.
#
# ponytail: MISSING is reported, not fatal — some declared containers are
# on-demand or run outside compose (the reconcile's `absent` list). Make it
# fatal once build.json can say which containers a deploy must create.
