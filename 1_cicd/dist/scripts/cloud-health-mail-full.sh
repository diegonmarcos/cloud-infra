# ── Full mail health diagnostic + cross-store reconciliation ──
# Usage: cloud-health-mail-full.sh
#
# Three layers, all must pass:
#
#  1. LIVENESS/E2E — triggers the Rust cloud-mail-health-full derive on
#     oci-apps (identical docker invocation to obs.health.mail —
#     a_solutions/infra-api_c3-infra-mcp/src/code/mcp/tools/health_mail.ts —
#     and to the working dagu DAG a_solutions/infra-obs_dagu/src/dags/
#     health_mail-full.yaml). 7-phase path/container/network/DNS/e2e probe.
#     Gate: .summary.critical == 0.
#
#  2. CROSS-STORE RECONCILIATION — the liveness probe above does NOT compare
#     store contents, so a store silently falling behind (e.g. maddy's
#     dual-write to Stalwart failing) goes undetected — this is exactly what
#     caused the 2026-08-11..08-20 silent mail-loss incident. This layer takes
#     every message Gmail (authoritative primary) received in the last 24h and
#     fails if more than tolerance of them are ABSENT from maddy or from
#     Stalwart, matched by Message-ID. Membership, not per-store counts: a
#     store stamps re-injected mail with its own arrival time, so counting what
#     each store "received in 24h" read the health_mail-reconcile DAG's
#     2026-09-14 repair of 146 old messages as "gmail=32 maddy=178
#     stalwart=181" for a day (details in count-since.ts). Reuses existing
#     scripts, no new clients/credentials:
#       - a_solutions/infra-api_google-workspace-mcp/src/code/gmail/count_recent.py --message-ids
#         (Gmail REST API via the container's service account, run via
#         `docker exec google-workspace-mcp`)
#       - a_solutions/infra-api_cloud-mail-mcp/src/code/mcp/tools/others/count-since.ts
#         (maddy IMAP + Stalwart JMAP, run via `docker exec cloud-mail-mcp`)
#     Both containers run on oci-apps (see each service's build.json
#     deploy.host). The Message-IDs are piped from one container into the other
#     ON oci-apps and never reach this job's log — only the counts come back.
#
#  3. SEND/RECEIVE ROUND-TRIP — nothing above proves a message submitted now
#     is delivered. a_solutions/infra-api_cloud-mail-mcp/src/code/mcp/tools/others/round-trip.ts
#     (run via `docker exec cloud-mail-mcp`, credentials from that container's
#     sops-deployed env) submits one message with a random Message-ID, asserts
#     it reaches maddy (IMAP) and Stalwart (JMAP) within 180s, and removes it.
#     Gate: sent and received by both stores.
#
# Three outcomes, not two (#398):
#   exit 0  every layer ran and passed.
#   exit 1  a layer ran and the mail stack answered badly — a mail fault.
#   exit 2  INCONCLUSIVE: the check could not reach oci-apps at all, so it knows
#           nothing about the mail stack and says so instead of guessing. The
#           two are separated because they used to share one label: every
#           non-zero outcome of every layer appended the literal string
#           "SSH/docker error", chosen without looking at the output (which on
#           the liveness layer was not even captured), so a dead mailbox and a
#           dropped mesh connection reached the owner as the same sentence. The
#           cause is named now by 1_cicd/src/ops/cloud-health-mail-failure-classifier.sh
#           against the rules in 9_others/mail-health-diagnosis.json, which also
#           declares the hardened SSH options every call here uses.
#
# Requires (set up by the caller — see 1_cicd/src/cicd/health_mail_full.yml):
#   - SSH config alias `oci-apps` (same pattern as
#     1_cicd/src/cicd/cloud-health-reports.yml's "Setup SSH config" step)
#   - jq and tar on PATH (ubuntu-latest ships both)
# Optional:
#   - NTFY_URL — ntfy alert on pass/fail, same topic/headers/tags the working
#     dagu DAG health_mail-full.yaml already uses (unauthenticated: ntfy's
#     server.yml.tpl sets auth-default-access: read-write, and the dagu DAG's
#     own ntfy calls carry no Authorization header — see
#     a_solutions/infra-obs_dagu/src/dags/health_mail-full.yaml). Sending a
#     Bearer header here instead gets ntfy's OWN auth.db involved, which does
#     not recognise an Authelia-issued token and 401s ({"code":40101}) —
#     learned the hard way, do not re-add it. If NTFY_URL is unreachable the
#     alert is skipped with a warning but the check itself still exits
#     non-zero on failure, which GitHub's own scheduled-workflow-failure
#     email will surface either way.
#   - AUTHELIA_BEARER_TOKEN / AUTHELIA_TOKEN_URL / AUTHELIA_OIDC_CLIENT_ID /
#     AUTHELIA_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET — feed BEARER_TOKEN into the liveness
#     report container (layer 1's own Authelia-gated internal checks), NOT
#     the ntfy alert. If unset, that report step fails its own auth-gated
#     probes rather than skipping anything ntfy-related.
