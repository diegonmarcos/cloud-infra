    # ("ERROR: nix build failed" / "Full nix output:") unreachable dead code.
    # Every nix failure therefore surfaced as a bare
    #     FATAL: step 'docker-package' failed (exit 1)
    # with the eval error discarded.

    # already exited the process. Proven by run 31619077590 attempt 2, which had

    # FATAL with no nix output.

    # The devShell is an OPTIMISATION, not a requirement — the `-d` guard below
    # already falls back to a bare `nix build`. `${CLOUD_ROOT:?}` turned that

# a hard link at the destination — but if the link target's directory has
# not been copied yet, cp errors:
#   cp: cannot create hard link '/host/nix/store/A/x' to '/host/nix/store/B/x'
# Worse, the original loop swallowed those failures silently:
#   cp -a "$p" "$HOST/nix/store/$base" && COPIED=$((COPIED + 1))
# bash's `set -e` does NOT trigger on `cmd1 && cmd2` (it's "tested"), so a
# failed cp left no copy on host but the loop continued — the activation
# generation path never made it to host, then activate failed with
# "activation path not found or not executable" (incident 2026-05-01).
# Fix: drop --preserve=links (via --no-preserve=links). Each hard-linked
# source becomes an independent copy at destination; nix-store's GC re-
# establishes the hard links via .links/ later. Plus fail-loud explicit
# error handling — a real cp failure now aborts and is visible.
